        <h1>Inernetings Is Easy</h1>
        <p>First, we need to learn some basic HTML.</p>

        <h2>Headings</h2>
        <p>Hedings define the outline of your site. there are six levels of headings.</p>

        <h2>Lists</h2>

    <p>This is how you make  an unordered list:</p>

     <u1>
        <li>Add a "u1" element (it stands for unordered list)</li>
        <li>Add each item in its own "1i" element</li>
        <li>They don't need to be in any particular order</li>
    </u1>

    <p>This is what ordered list looks like</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Notice the new "ol" element wrapping everything</li>
        <li>But, the list item elements are the same</li>
        <li>Also note how the numbers increment on their own</li>
        <li>You should be noticing things is this precise order, because this is an ordered list </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Inline Elements</h2>

    <p><em>Sometimes</em>, you need to draw attention to a particular word or phrase.</p>

    <p>Other times you need <strong>strong</strong>ly emphasize the importance of a word or phrase</p>

    <p><em><strong>And sometimes you need to shout!</strong></em></p>

    <h2> Empty Elements</h2>

    <p>Thanks for rading! Interneting should be getting easier now.</p>
